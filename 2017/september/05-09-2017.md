- i woke up this morning about 9am, felt like a bit of a sleep in (always do) but nah, gotta get to work and smash out some shit! :D
- train ride is usually boring, watched one of my favourite streamers ([shroud](https://www.twitch.tv/shroud)) play PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv) while on the train...
  - shroud is a fucking freak at gaming
  - now i feel like playing PUBG tonight...
- went out to taco bill for lunch with the work fam for my director's birthday, got some tasty tacos 
- also had chocolate mousse cake, and that was marv
- getting a lot of work done today which is good! building a new web app, so the next couple of weeks are busy for me... but im always busy at work...
